# Library for APC230-43

A library that allows us to handle the transceiver APC230-43 through the microcontroller MSP430FR4133. It's a library quite simple where the first step is to configure the pins, then configures the UART communication, and finally start the communication. In the main and ISR, we can see an example of implementation.
